Object Detection
Object Detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and locates objects in images or videos. Unlike image classification, which only labels an image, object detection provides bounding boxes around each detected object along with its class label.

📌 Features
Detects multiple objects in an image or video.

Provides bounding boxes and confidence scores.

Works with real-time camera feeds or pre-recorded media.

Supports popular models like YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN.

🔧 How It Works
Input: Image or video frame.

Feature Extraction: Model processes the input using CNN-based feature extractors.

Bounding Box Prediction: The model predicts box coordinates and class labels.

Output: Image/video with labeled bounding boxes drawn.

🛠️ Installation
Clone the repository:

🚀 Usage
Detect objects in an image:
bash
Copy
Edit
python detect.py --image path/to/image.jpg
Detect objects in real-time (webcam):
bash
Copy
